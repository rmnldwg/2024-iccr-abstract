abstract: |
  We previously developed a mechanistic hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict the
  lymphatic tumor progression in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs). To
  extend the model to other tumor subsites, defined by ICD-10 codes, in the head and
  neck, we employ a mixture of these HMMs and learn the cluster assignments and model
  parameters in an iterative, EM-like algorithm from multi-centric data. The mixture
  model manages to cluster anatomically close subsites and correctly infers the
  clusters' parameters. Using this mixture model allows the prediction of individual
  risks of occult nodal disease, given a diagnosis that includes tumor subsite.
